## Overview

Given a batch of reasoning queries and a fixed compute budget, how should we
allocate test-time compute across queries to maximize accuracy?

This repository provides:

- **Baselines** — greedy, best-of-N, self-consistency (native); TALE, BEST-Route (external wrappers)
- **Allocators** — budget allocation strategies (currently: equal allocation)
- **Evaluation** — exact-match accuracy, per-query logging, compute tracking
- **Experiment runner** — config-driven script tying everything together

Currently uses a dummy model for pipeline validation.  The model interface
supports drop-in replacement with API-based LLMs.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# greedy baseline (1 sample per query, 50 GSM8K test queries)
python3 scripts/run_experiment.py --config configs/greedy.yaml

# best-of-N (5 samples per query)
python3 scripts/run_experiment.py --config configs/best_of_n.yaml

# self-consistency (majority vote, 5 samples)
python3 scripts/run_experiment.py --config configs/self_consistency.yaml

# equal allocation under budget constraint
python3 scripts/run_experiment.py --config configs/equal_allocator.yaml
```

Results are saved as JSON in `outputs/`.

## Simulated Sweep Diagnostics

The repository also includes a lightweight synthetic analysis flow for studying
when classical allocation optimization helps over equal allocation and how that
advantage changes with noisy utility estimates.

```bash
# run the synthetic budget/noise sweep
python3 scripts/run_simulated_sweep.py --config configs/simulated_sweep.yaml

# summarize sweep CSV outputs into a compact table and optional plots
python3 scripts/summarize_simulated_results.py
```

The summary script reads the CSV outputs under `outputs/simulated_sweep/`,
writes `outputs/simulated_sweep/summary_table.csv`, prints key budget/noise
metrics to the terminal, and saves simple plots under
`outputs/simulated_sweep/plots/` when `matplotlib` is available.

## Tests & Linting

```bash
pytest
ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/
```

## Config Format

```yaml
dataset:
  name: gsm8k
  split: test
  max_samples: 50

model:
  type: dummy
  correct_prob: 0.3
  seed: 42

baseline: greedy          # greedy | best_of_n | self_consistency
n_samples: 1
budget: 50

output: outputs/results.json
```
